We used the ticket found on Imagenet and used it on  <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIPHAR-100</a>.

## CIFAR-100

This dataset 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).
